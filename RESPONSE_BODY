 RESPONSE_BODY
 Exercise 4 of 11

Create an app that returns a stream when the client requests /stream and a JSON body when the client requests /json.

When /json is requested, the output should be

    { foo: 'bar' }

When /stream is requested, the server should respond with the content in file process.argv[3]. Use fs.createReadStream:

    fs.createReadStream(process.argv[3]);

HINT

So far, we've only used strings as bodies. Koa supports the following types of bodies:

  * Strings
  * Buffers
  * Streams (node)
  * JSON Objects

    app.use(function* (next) {
      this.body = {
        message: 'this will be sent as a JSON response!'
      };
    })

When setting a stream as a body, Koa will automatically add error handlers so you don't have to worry about error handling.

    var fs = require('fs');

    app.use(function* (next) {
      this.body = fs.createReadStream('some_file.txt');
      // koa will automatically handle errors and leaks
    })
